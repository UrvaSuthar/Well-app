# Building the App with Expo CLI

This guide covers the steps necessary to build the app using Expo CLI for both Android and iOS platforms.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI

You can install Expo CLI by running `npm install -g expo-cli`.

## Building the App

To build the app for Android or iOS, you will use the following commands:

- `expo build:android` - Builds the app for Android.
- `expo build:ios` - Builds the app for iOS.

Before running these commands, make sure your `app.json` is properly set up according to your app's requirements.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the build process, consider the following tips:
- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and up to date.
- Check the Expo CLI documentation for any known issues.
- Try cleaning the project by removing the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` or `yarn install` again.

For more detailed information, refer to the [Expo CLI documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/).

Open the `App.js` file to start writing some code. You can preview the changes directly on your phone or tablet by scanning the **QR code** or use the iOS or Android emulators. When you're done, click **Save** and share the link!

When you're ready to see everything that Expo provides (or if you want to use your own editor) you can **Download** your project and use it with [expo cli](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/#expo-cli)).
